	/// <summary>
	/// The logic of loading our model got too complicated to stay embedded in the main class.
	/// Also, we want to share it with the RasterPropMonitor display screen.
	/// This isn't a full "behavior" object, but it can be used by one to take care of a lot of tasks.
	///
	/// This class is responsible for loading the main model object and providing functions to
	/// refresh it as needed.
	/// It defers some operations to the background and keeps track of when it's OK to do that.
	///
	/// There's no point in calculating if the window isn't open, so we suppress calculations in that case.
	/// We also abort any load request that happens while another load is already in progress.
	/// We call it an "open display" so our Raster Prop Monitor widget can get in on the act.
	///
	/// We need to refresh the data when the orbit changes, but if you do a ten-minute burn,
	/// we can't churn the CPU constantly for that entire time.
	/// So we require that at least 5 seconds have passed since the last calculation.
	///
	/// However, if the user toggles the window rapidly, or switches focus in the tracking station,
	/// we need to calculate regardless of whether 5 seconds have passed!
	/// The same goes for if another calculation is in progress.
	///
	/// Burns can expire if their burn time elapses into the past, so we need to check them once per second.
